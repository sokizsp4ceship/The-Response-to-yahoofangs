The so called "apology" ive received


heya im a player from pony town most people know as "soki" i recently was copied by "@dreamingfangs" before it was changed to "@yahoofangs" and i just want to say the "apology" i got wasn't a apology at all its mostly him explaining the story all the way wrong. hes saying what he wants to say which makes him look like the victim. im not "victimizing" myself im here to explain what ACTUALLY happened and ask to be left alone. 

first of all the "getting mad because was whispered while sleeping" part i wasnt mad cuz i was whispered 2 days in a row abt inspo taking, i was mad BECAUSE u are still taking inspo of my skins basically taking my style. 
second of all thats not even the FULL story of what happened. 

What really happened was ive gotten whispers and questions about this "fang" person taking inspo/copying my style so i reached out and yes he confessed. so i asked for those skins to be deleted. and i get a "do i have to? " uhm yes??? then fang says something like "its just i worked so hard on those skins" oky?? thts still my style?? SO i decided fang could keep THOSE Skins ONLY n put credits after the credits were added i thought it was over, so i moved on. then the whispering constantly started. i would wake up to 8 whispers abt how he "NEEDS" to make a skin in my style n asking me to "hurry up and reply". mind u. im sleeping obviously. 

so thats when i got mad because its still my style and just because i said ask to inspo doesn't mean litt ask to inspo EACH time a skin was made or make the skin n give credits u gotta realize its STILL MY STYLE. after that i hid fang and he took my credits out so i unhid and told him to delete them now and was hidden after. multiple people started calling him out and he kept running away. what makes this worse i was @ed on his gh and was told to dni. so please leave me alone and stop trying to get through with a "apology"

the apology u send didn't have one sorry in it. it had u explaining the story all wrong in it. 

im 20. and i would appreciate it if u left me alone.
